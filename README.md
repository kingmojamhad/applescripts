## Useful scripts

This project consists of some scripts that I find useful

### Google Hangouts in Google Chrome

This directory contains 3 stripts for automating use of Google Hangouts:

* `google_hanguts/toggle_microphone.applescript`: this script can be
  used as part of an Automator script for muting and unmuting a Google
  Hangouts microphone without needing to switch to the Hangouts window.
* `google_hanguts/toggle_camera.applescript`: this script can be
  used as part of an Automator script for toggling a Google
  Hangouts camera without needing to switch to the Hangouts window.
* `google_hanguts/focus_window.applescript`: this script can be used
  as part of an Automator script to focus a Google Hangouts window
